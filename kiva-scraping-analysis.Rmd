Number of unique loans in sample: `r length(unique(observations$id))`.

Did loans meet our criteria?

```{r}
observations %>%
  filter(id %in% pilot_loan_ids) %>% 
  select(id, fundraisingDate, plannedExpirationDate, loanAmount) %>%
  unique()
```

Loans we could have matched (assuming correct criteria):

```{r}
observations %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  filter(time >= "2019-05-23 02:45:00" & time <= "2019-05-23 03:00:00") %>%
  filter(loanAmount <= 1000) %>%
  filter(fundraisingDate < time & fundraisingDate >= time - dhours(24)) %>%
  select(id, fundraisingDate, plannedExpirationDate, loanAmount) %>%
  unique()
```
