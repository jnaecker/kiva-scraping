Did loans meet our criteria?

```{r}
observations %>%
  filter(id %in% pilot_loan_ids) %>% 
  select(id, fundraisingDate, plannedExpirationDate, loanAmount) %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(fundraisingDate)
```

Loans we could have matched (assuming correct criteria):

```{r}
observations %>%
  mutate(id = as.character(id)) %>%
  filter(time >= timeLower & time <= timeUpper) %>%
  filter(loanAmount <= 1000) %>%
  filter(fundraisingDate < time & fundraisingDate >= time - dhours(24)) %>%
  select(id, fundraisingDate, plannedExpirationDate, loanAmount) %>%
  unique() %>%
  arrange(fundraisingDate)
```
